This is a lightweight and modern IDE made with Python and in the future with some other languages.

Currently, we have some cool features like :

  -PyLint Verification.
  -Search in web function.
  -Git integrated.
  -Black formatting.
  -To-do List.

  And in the future :

  -LSP autocompletion.
  -StackOverflow search.
  -Plugin support.
  -AI-assisted code (Probably)
  -MySQL integration (Probably)

If you are running this with the Python File, you'll need Python 3.12 and the following packages:
pyqt6-tools
qtawesome
black
pylint

Thank you!
